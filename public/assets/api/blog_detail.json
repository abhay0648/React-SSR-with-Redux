  "short_description": "Real Estate witnessed declines in deal and funding activity from 2018 to 2019. The Real Estate industry saw sizable investment activity over the last 5 years, a total of 16 investment deals from 2015 to 2019. Excluding investments that took place in 2020, 2018 saw the highest total funding raised by MENA-based Real Estate startups of $123M, mainly attributable to Propertyfinder's $120M Series C fund-raise. The United Arab Emirates accounts for the lion's share in Real Estate funding, accounting for more than 90% of total funding raised since 2015.",
